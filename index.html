      <hr>
      <p>Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe and are show a redshifts, up to
        <code>z = 9</code>. It’s been almost five decades since they have been discovered (1973) but their origin and
        mechanism are the focus of intense research and debate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The electromagnetic energy output during tens of seconds by a Gamma-ray burst is comparable to that of the
          Sun over ∼few×$10^{10}$ years, the approximate age of the universe or to that of our entire Milky Way over a
          few years.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h1 id="spatial-distribution">Spatial distribution</h1>
      <p>Let’s start with the angular distribution. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts on the galactic
        coordinates. Gamma ray bursts are essentially isotropic on the galactic coordinates, implying that the origins
        are extra-galactic.</p>
      <p>![[Pasted image 20221129224643.png]]
        Figure 1: Distribution of 2704 GRBs on Galactic coordinates. We see an isotropic distribution.</p>
      <p>If the distribution of GRBs is radially homogenous it will have to follow:
        $$
        N(S) = \frac{4}{3}\pi n\bigg( \frac{E}{4\pi S} \bigg)^{3/2}
        $$</p>
      <p>Where,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$S$: Fluence integrated over time</li>
        <li>$N(S)$ is the number of sources with fluence greater than $S$.</li>
        <li>$n$ is the number of sources per unit volume</li>
        <li>$E$ is the intrinsic energy of the burst (kept fixed for this analysis)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>![[Pasted image 20221129225002.png]]
        Figure 2: Number of burst as a function of $C<em>{max}/C</em>{min}$ (same as having $S$ on this axis). </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 we see that the $N \propto S^{-3/2}$ is violated, this implies that GRBs do not extend infinitely
        into space, although this could just be an effect from observational limitations.</p>
      <h1 id="classification">Classification</h1>
      <p>As can be seen from Figure 3 Gamma ray bursts do not have a specific profile/signature, hence we should
        consider the possibility that there may exist multiple physical processes which can lead to such a phenomenon.
        To get a grasp on the type of physical processes which might be involved, we will start classifying GRBs and
        then try to find sources independently.</p>
      <p>![[Pasted image 20221129221950.png]]
        Figure 3: Representative plot for 4 random GRBs from BATSE</p>
      <p>Based on the time it takes for the wave to die to 90% we can separate GRBs into two main classes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Long Gamma Ray Burst (LGRB): $(t_{90} \geq 2s)$<ul>
            <li>Suspected source: the core-collapse of a massive star or collapsar </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Short Gamma Ray Burst (SGRB): $(t_{90} \leq 2s)$<ul>
            <li>Suspected source: the binary neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) or NS-NS mergers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The separation of GRBs into short and long classes was suggested by their duration distributions and reinforced
        by differences in the prompt gamma-ray emission of the two classes.</p>
      <h1 id="sgrb">SGRB</h1>
      <p>Short Gamma Ray Bursts die down to 90% of their amplitude in less than 2 seconds. The suspected sources of
        SGRBs are NS-BH or NS-NS mergers. One such NS-NS merger was observed on 2017 August 17 by multiple independent
        projects via two different physics channels. The Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors along with others detected a
        gravitational wave event (GW170817), and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor along with others detected a GRB (GRB
        170817A). The fact that carriers for both the signals namely gravitational waves and gamma rays travel at the
        same speed ($c$) hints to the fact that they might be from the same source, but further conformation is
        required. The source was localised and see if everyone was looking in the same direction. Shown in Figure 4 is
        Final localization of the source direction in the Equitorial coordinate system. We see that the transient
        observation point lies in all the contours.</p>
      <p>![[Pasted image 20221129215014.png]]
        Figure 4: Green represents 90% contour from Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, Purple represents 90% contour
        from GBM, the grey region is the 90% annulus determined with <em>Fermi</em> and INTEGRAL, and the star
        represents the optical position where the transient was observed.</p>
      <p>Since the deployment of Swift detector it has been found out that SGRBs are followed by a X-ray afterglow.
        Hence any simulation of a source of GRB should also produce that. </p>
      <p>A Relativistic Hydrodynamic simulation of NS-NS merger was performed for two models, narrow-engine and
        wide-engine. The narrow jet engine penetrates the debris cloud surrounding the merger site and propagates
        successfully into the circum-merger medium. This successful jet may drive a classical SGRB if viewed on axis. In
        contrast, the wide-jet engine fails to break out of the merger cloud, and instead drives a quasi-spherical shock
        through the cloud and into the surrounding medium. Both the simulations show an X-ray afterglow. Hence, we can
        conclude that the narrow-engine model is the closest model for explaining SGRBs.</p>
